Click <a href="https://davidteju.dev/projects/David-O-Meter/">here</a></p></blockquote><h2>What is this?</h2><p>This is a program/webpage that displays the ratio of positive to neutral to negative tweets that mention the word &quot;David&quot;.<br>         The David-O-Meter measures the overall sentiment toward Davids around the world  :)</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>The java program first sends a request to the Twitter API to return <strong>recent tweets that mention the word &quot;David&quot;</strong> from Twitter users not named David.<br>         Then the returned <strong>JSON data is parsed</strong> and the tweets are formatted into a format recognizable by Azure Cognitive Services. The new JSON containing the tweets' text content is sent to the Azure Cognitive Services API for <strong>sentiment analysis</strong>.<br>         The returned data is then parsed again, and any sentiment with a <strong>.5+</strong> confidence score is added to its' aggregate count. For example, a tweet with a positive score of .6, negative of .15 and negative of .25 would increase the positive sentiment count by 1<br>         Twitter limits me to <strong>300 API requests per 15 minutes</strong> so this process is run every 3 seconds to have it repeat no more than 300 times in 15 minutes. Every 15 minutes, <strong>the <code>sentimentValues.json</code> file</strong>—which contains the total values of each sentiment—is updated, commited, and pushed to the repo<br>         When a client visits the webpage, the initial HTML/CSS will have each sentiment in 1 of 3 bars in a flex container, all with equal lengths and content. The JavaScript will then parse the values from <code>sentimentValues.json</code> and <strong>update each sentiment's flex-grow property</strong> (to create the ratio in length) and its content/innerHTML to display the percentage for that sentiment.</p><h2>Why did I do this?</h2><p>I wanted to learn about APIs, how to use them and how to use the data extracted from them in client-facing software/sites. So, instead of buying an expensive course to slowly learn it, I decided to think of a simple non-controversial project to work on and learn across the way with the help of documentation (Twitter API documentation sucks though) and Google (I actually use Bing).</p><h2>Am I finished?</h2><p>Short answer: <strong>No</strong><br>Long answer: While the project and site are functional, here's some features and stuff I wish to add soon:</p><ul><li>Ability to see sentiment values for the last hour and last 24 hours</li><li>Ability to see the recently analysed positive, neutral and negative tweets</li><li>Ability to download program software as jar and deploy it to analyze and display sentiment for whatever key word/phrase you choose</li></ul>
